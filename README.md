# Portfolio Project: Life Expectenc and GDP

This project will investigate if there is a strong correlation between the economic output of a country and the life expectancy of its citizens.

The goals are to prepare data, followed by analysis with plots, and seek to explain the findings from the study.

Here are a few questions that this project will seek to answer:

+ Has life expectancy increased over time in the six nations?
+ Has GDP increased over time in the six nations?
+ Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?
+ What is the average life expectancy in these nations?
+ What is the average GDP in these nations?
+ Which country has experienced the fastest increase in life expectancy over time?
+ What is the distribution of that life expectancy?
+ Is there a time lag between GDP growth and improvements in life expectancy?
+ Which country shows the largest fluctuation in life expectancy or GDP over time?
